# TODO after the HDFS group (2026-10-06 night)

Order:
1. HDFS is finished (STATE §0): its follow-up items below are optional engine work, done when a later system needs
   them or before a clean final acceptance run.
2. Solr.
3. HBase.
4. ZooKeeper.

The owner: "hdfs所有的case跑完为一组，不要有回归。然后就到另一个系统". Each system is finished when every one of its
checks has an exported `.smt` that is right (SAT confirmed, or UNSAT at the fixed point) and every known bug of it
passes. Branch, tree and path details are in [STATE.md](STATE.md); every check with its state in
[../checks/README.md](../checks/README.md) and its reading in [../STATUS.md](../STATUS.md); commands in
[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md); speed and the cluster in [../design/PERFORMANCE.md](../design/PERFORMANCE.md).

## HDFS (finished: `system/hdfs` 39 cases, `system/hdfs1` 7; trees r7, r7-21, r8, 11741-r6; image `vm-hg5`)

46 of 46 cases closed with a hand-read `.smt` (STATUS "HDFS checks"); no new bug; every case ran alone on the ten
lifts for its time breakdown (EX1, PERFORMANCE §6). What is left is the general work the
workarounds stand in for, the defects the session found, and the cleanup. None of it reopens a closed case unless a
change alters its formula; any engine change below reruns the affected cases on `system/hdfs1` (one change per round,
RULES "Lock, then one change at a time").

### 1. The two-phase final acceptance run (owner 2026-10-06, for later)
For one clean run of all 46 on one body (once the items below are in or declined): (1) the ~36 short cases a few at a
time (6-8 concurrent: their time is serial SEED, recording and seed replay, so exclusivity buys them little); (2) the
deep closures (11741 08 09 05 06 11 14, 07) one at a time with the whole cluster (their cost is hundreds of obligation
replays, which fan out: 09 has 653 verdicts over 9 tasks and 7 regions). Expected ~4-5 h in all versus ~9-10 h with
every case exclusive. Note: the 39 cases of `system/hdfs` ran on the locked body, which lacks codec capture, open
arms, the wait deadline and the open-arm keys; a run of them on `system/hdfs1` is that final run's first check.
11741 needs `CASE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=14400`.

### 2. The general fixes the workarounds stand in for
- **21**: a loop root's prefix as its own occurrence (§3) and the stranded activation (§4); then 21 runs on r7 without
  its tree and loop-bounds file.
- **07**: index a decoded reply's consumer by the send ordinal of the request it answers, not by the order the code reads
  it (STATUS open defect 57; `MessageDoors#send` records correlation id -> ordinal, `Identity#endpointAt`,
  `WireExport#attachLeaf`; ~50 lines + a test). Needed for HBase and ZooKeeper too (they iterate replies out of
  `HashMap`s). Then 07 runs on r7 without r8, and its world depth back at the default if it converges.
- **The time family** (21 22 23 24 25 34 35 52): the r7 workarounds (STATUS "Per-system surface") stay; the time model
  is never ground on (RULES).
- **Native reproduction of a clock world**: none exists (`NATIVE_PLANT_UNSUPPORTED`); 11741's validation is CONFIRM's
  replay. A native clock plant (an agent-side clock offset per node) would give it a k/N.

### 3. A loop root's prefix as its own occurrence (general fix for 21's tree workaround; design ready)
A LOOP_BODY_ROOT occurrence's activations are its loop's iterations, so what its root method runs before the loop
is observed by none (21: `BPServiceActor.run`'s handshake, `checkNNVersion`). Merging the prefix into the first
iteration (branch `hdfs1-prefix-span` 1f14e68c7) stretched the actor occurrence over the whole service loop: its
offerService iteration never reaches a terminal, so an admitted replay's rows go unpublished (PS2-21: a BLOCKING
nested cut on an unstated flip), and every arm is keyed by the heartbeats delivered after it (PS1-11: 1319 asks).
Design: (1) the prefix's address is the loop-body occurrence's plus one index frame `<loopRuntimeId>:prefix@0`
(`OccurrenceAddress#prefix`, one function for PLAN and the runtime); (2) PLAN gives a LOOP_BODY_ROOT region whose
root method calls region work before the loop header a PREFIX task (same region, node and loop-root hook group,
rootAuthority `LOOP_PREFIX`), and the declared anchor goes on it when the root-method call it is reached through
lies outside the loop body; (3) `LoopAccounting#enterLoopRoot` opens the prefix task's activation, the first body
entry ends it NORMAL (published) and admits the body's own as on the merged body, the root's exit ends it with no
iteration, a cut ends it CUT; it counts against no loop-body budget; `PrefixSpan#atBody` and the "one activation,
two spans" text go; (4) no key change. Offline (PS1-11, current key): the actor's (arm, key) pairs 17008 merged,
7216 split (prefix 5327, body 1889); the prefix joins 11's closure as an `allKeys` writer, which the merged body
never did. Still owed with it: an activation stranded at session end publishes CUT (no ADMITTED verdict over
unpublished rows).

### 4. A stranded activation's rows (21's residue; evidence: W21's 3 BLOCKING gaps)
An activation whose root is still running when the session ends is stranded (`ConcolicResultPublisher#
strandWithoutTerminal`, TERMINAL_NEVER_REACHED): its path is withheld, only its mints publish, yet the replay's
verdict can stand ADMITTED (`FocusedReplay` saw the flipped arm taken). A nested path then cut from that session
inherits a flip the session does not state: W21 (`/bigtemp/vnr3ne/gc-out/hdfs-21w/accept-W21`), BLOCKING EXPLORE
`ADMISSION_GAP`s `updateActorStatesFromHeartbeat` u93#2/#3/#5 at the actor body occurrence 1bc6719160f7e094
(obligations ce70720a45fc2503, 12f86ac9a0cf4a8a, 97207921c23d9e9c); 4 of W21's 5 sessions stranded that body
(PS2-21: the same at u93#4). Fix, one of: (a) a stranded activation publishes CUT, as a bounded cut does: the VM
region closes only on its own thread, so the strand asks the owner thread to end at its next hook (a held
schedule wait released at session end) through `LoopAccounting#endAtCut`, the barrier waits for it under the same
grace, and one that reaches no hook makes its replay's obligations admit nothing
(`FocusedReplay#noteUnsettledPublication`), no new verdict; or (b) no nested path is cut from a session whose
flipped activation published no rows. Today's corpora of 07 (CC7), 11741 (AW5), 29 30 40 (HF1) and 39 (WD3) hold
no stranded activation, so either touches only perpetual bodies like 21's actor.


### 5. Defects found this session (STATUS "Open defects" has each with its fix)
- **52-56, codec capture review**: a getter on a message no door decoded attaches nothing, silently (52); SEED derives
  no port for a two-field getter or an unresolved class (53); a refused setter export leaves the builder's earlier
  element bound (54); the input-shape key does not record which producer fed which site (55); a protobuf object kept
  as state is not tracked as state (56). None is on a closed case's path (the review read 07, 11741, 12).
- **58/59, open-arm bookkeeping** (T): an obligation id carries no path and no world, so two worlds can share one; and
  the id drifts as the corpus grows. 39 closes, but its closure varied run to run before the open-arm keys (CHECKING
  trap 18).
- **51**: the arm key's u18#3 gap (rule 1 and the own-fault key missed the throughput bar; branches parked).
- **Confirm-first** (`hdfs1-confirm-first` da913cd7c, parked): a returned confirmation is decided only by the next
  step, behind any witness attempt in flight. With the Cone fix that costs minutes (HF2: 15 min from queue to
  accepted); merge if a confirmation is seen waiting > 10 min.
- **Scope (B)**, widening that would only make right formulas more flippable: 29/30 the block-pool map written at
  DataNode start-up and `bpServiceToActive`'s in-window writer gated by HA state; 17's lease and 39's IBR ordering
  (turns on threads with no schedule events); an identity compare of a tracked reference with an enum constant states
  no VM term (VM.md §5.2); 05's thread-local buffer invariant; String fields (21's versions; defect 34); 14's retry
  identity and its constant arm; 11's u18#3 key gap; 20's txid.
- A possible flake: Mockito `UnfinishedStubbingException` in `TestBlockRecovery2`.

### 6. Speed (PERFORMANCE.md §5)
- **Incremental planning** (owner 2026-10-07: "这个优化记做todo吧"; the first speed item). Each EXPLORE round's planner
  is a fresh `ExploreMain` JVM that reads the whole corpus from disk, builds every index (slot table, branches,
  frontier, writer arms) and plans, then exits; only the sessions that landed since the last round are new. In
  EX1-adhoc-07d (exclusive, 2h50m) the 16 rounds' planners took 1h51m of EXPLORE's 2h25m: a round grew from 2 s to
  19-22 min as the corpus reached ~640 sessions (17 min of it waiting for memory beside 12-14 GB host solvers),
  while the ten lifts ran 4-71 solves and replays at once. More lifts would save at most 10-20 %. Design: keep the
  planner's corpus and indexes across rounds (a serving planner, as the host solver already reads only the
  sessions that landed since its last question, `Corpus#read(Path, Path, Corpus)`), read only the new sessions,
  update only the tasks and arms they touch, and stop rewriting `slots.jsonl` whole; gate: the incremental rounds'
  outputs byte-identical to the full recomputation on recorded corpora (`offline-ab.sh` `EXPLORE.N`,
  `EXPLORE.drift`), since dependence keys and the fixed point are corpus-wide.
- **A host solver answers one question at a time** at 12-14 GB resident on 07's corpus: more answers per solver JVM
  (or a smaller one) would lift the solve throughput and the memory every lift gives replays.
- 11741 takes 1.5 h on the cluster (HF2: witness at ~60 min, confirmed at ~75 min, 5168 s in all).
- The ledger's ~1.6x over real use (step charges at their start heap).

### 7. Cleanup still owed (RULES: every change deletes what it replaces)
- Cleanup batch 1, phase 2 (`brief-cleanup-1.md`): MapFields.safe/Text.safe copies, LineageScan's classFiles copy,
  ScheduleLog.prefixFile, run_engine.sh's `input_flag=-j` branch, test-only accessors, `src/test/resources/
  external-callers.txt`'s stale rows, the four-hop door API (MessageDoors should call RuntimeTraceContext directly),
  CausynthTraceRecorder's offline aggregation into its own class, CausynthPipeline's weaves apart from orchestration,
  DependencyRole.
- `hdfs-refactor-compose` step 5 (Composer.compose/run as steps; SmtLowering -> VmTermLowering + SmtSymbolTable), gated
  identical; merge `system/hdfs1` into it first.
- The VM's dead natives and `exportLeaf`/`mintLeaf` with the next VM build (STATE §3).
- Loop-bound rows keyed structurally, not by Jimple unit ordinals (a tree change renumbers `#uN`).
- Merged and parked branches and their worktrees (STATE §2), the superseded trees (r7b and older) and their Maven
  repos, stale snapshots (STATE §3; `tools/rounds/snapshot-gc.sh`), finished agents' `gc-out` dirs,
  `/bigtemp/vnr3ne/gc-out/diag-11741`, `/bigtemp/vnr3ne/readout-stream/` once its numbers are in STATUS.

## Solr (next; `system/solr` = main today)

**1. Bring the body.** Merge `system/hdfs1` (the newest body; the HDFS work ends as two branches and does not go
to `main`, owner 2026-10-06) into `system/solr`, and merge the parked `hdfs1-confirm-first` first if Solr's long
campaigns show a confirmation waiting behind witness attempts. The WIRE-CODEC runtime is gone from the
body; check that no Solr tree hook calls a removed door (`MessageDoors` payload/bytes overloads; the 3-arg
`stored`/`fetched` stay). Close the `MessageDoors.consumed` gap (a consumed Overseer item states its message key).
The Solr trees' `CausynthHttp` ends the served exchange by hand before each send: replace it by the request start at
the client's invoke point (`MessageDoors#requestStarting`/`#requestEnded`, IDENTITY §3), ending a received response only.
Rebase `solr-bug-reindex` onto it and fix its solr-18413 regression first:
- The seed replay stalls 103,812 times. A store-write slot is held while the Overseer's
  `waitForCoreAdminAsyncCallToComplete` poll outruns its recorded WAKE count. Read the jstacks in
  `gc-out/sbr/evidence/` (the time model of HDFS §3 may cover it).
- Then SBR26b: give SEED's trace aggregation the heap a 2.1 GB trace needs, or stream it.

**2. Mark the checks.** Mark the 13 checked study points in one Solr tree branch, from `docs/checks/SOLR.md` and
`SELECTION.md`:

```
05 07 09 10 13 14 19 21 22 31 38 39 40
```

22 is solr-18406's throw (already marked). Each point gets its cluster test as the workload and an experiment
directory like `experiments/hadoop/hdfs-adhoc` (a `checks.tsv`).

**3. The five admitted bugs:** migrate-buffer-leak #17, overseer-lock-leak #50, snapshot-no-active #16,
restore-construction #26, tra-start-overwrite #20. For each: the marker, the workload (an existing test where one
reaches it), the doors or roots its counterfactual needs (`docs/checks/VERIFIED-BUGS.md`), then a dev run.

**4. reindex-cleanup (#04).** The witness is #2's post-alias `setData` door faults.

**5. Run the group.** All 20 cases with no regression of solr-18406 and solr-18413, `.smt` checks (CHECKING.md), then
the final round of the group (concurrently, through the ledger).

## HBase (`system/hbase` = main today)

**0.** Before any HBase run on the new body: `hbase-unified` `CausynthRpc.java:61-62` drops `, call.param` (the payload
door is gone with WIRE-CODEC); rebuild hbase-client.

**1. Settle `hbase-startup`'s two design questions** (the lead decides; see [STATE.md](STATE.md) §2):
- An identity rule for threads started by libraries (ZooKeeper's EventThread, Netty event loops). They must not
  inherit their racing creator's frames.
- Message-bound exports for a value exported on one thread and sent by another after a queue (what WIRE-CODEC's
  message-bound exports did; the body no longer carries WIRE-CODEC, so design it on the current WIRE path).

**2. HBase #14 (master-active-time) to a confirmed CLOCK witness.**

**3. Mark the 17 checked study points** (`docs/checks/HBASE.md`):

```
04r 07r 08 10 11 12 13 14 15 19 20 21 22 24 31 34 37
```

04 and 07 are re-sited to the server: `AbstractStateMachineTableProcedure.java:163` and `SnapshotManager.java:1046`.

**4. The two admitted bugs.** backup-lock-reply-lost: needs a RESPONSE door on HBase RPC (`checkAndMutate` with
NO_NONCE). ns-rsgroup-removal: STATE re-pairing of `removeRSGroup`'s namespace read.

**5. Run the group of 20.**

## ZooKeeper (`system/zookeeper` = main today)

**1. Merge `hb-schedule` + `hb-sync`** onto the new body. Run the offline gate on V25; live runs of quota-init,
election-offer and 11741, comparing arm counts and refutations with V25. The ZooKeeper tree with the RESPONSE door is
`gc/zk-unified-hb` `47ddc8b36`.

**2. A quorum adapter.** Every selected ZooKeeper study test is a quorum test. Register each quorum peer as a node;
open the window once the quorum is up.

**3. Mark the 10 checked points** (`docs/checks/ZOOKEEPER.md`):

```
01 02 03 04 06 07 10 11 12 13
```

05 is a dead throw; 08 and 09 have no path.

**4. zk-bugs-container-reuse (#33).** A self-written ClientBase test; STATE re-pairing of the client's node-map lookup
to the cleanup's delete, the election-offer mechanism.

**5. Run the group of 13.**

## Cross-cutting (engine), when a system needs it

**WIRE-CODEC (`wire-codec-p1`; the system body carries none of it).** Resume only when a system's chain needs a
codec hole (a value carried inside an opaque payload); then rebase it onto the body, which deleted its runtime.

**VM performance.** The VM sends each expression node once per channel (STATUS open item 41). A plan budget should
be derived from the seed's measured cost.
